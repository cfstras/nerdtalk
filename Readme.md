# Nerdtalk #

Nerdtalk is the attempt of building a simple, fast and easy-to-use chat based community platform. The content is divided into threads and posts, which are created with at most one click.

It will feature intuitive ways to embed images, movies and text structure into posts.

## Framework ##
The backend is written in [Go](http://golang.org/) and is backed by [mongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).  
The frontend is mostly rendered templates and (soon) some jQuery.

## Note ##
Nerdtalk is still under development. Please don't expect it to run out of the box without any issues. If you would like to help develop Nerdtalk, feel free to fork, send pull requests or just drop me a message.
